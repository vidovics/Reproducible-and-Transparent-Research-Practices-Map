This table was pre-populated with some activities, infrastructures, and networks supporting Open Research by the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN) Institutional Lead with assistance from the UKRN Local Network Lead and colleagues contributing to the management of the UKRN local network.\nFollowing the initial population with examples the table was shared with the University’s Associate Deans Research, other members of its Open Research Group, and Deputy Heads of School Research for all schools to encourage completion of the table, or forwarding the opportunity to relevant stakeholders. Specific activities or centres of reproducible and transparent research practices were recorded as individual rows, their contributions were described, and their inter-relationships were recorded.\nRelationships were recorded by giving each activity/centre an ID and recording that ID in any rows where there was engagement, collaboration, or the sharing of staff between activity/centres.\n\n\nAnalysis\nAnalysis was performed in R using the packages below.\ninstall.packages(\"sna\") # \"social network analysis\" for network analysis functions\ninstall.packages(\"readr\") # reads .xls and .csv files\ninstall.packages(\"igraph\") # for network functions\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\") # for cleaning up tables/data frames\ninstall.packages(\"tidygraph\") # for cleaning up graphs\n\n\nlibrary(\"sna\")\nlibrary(\"readr\")\nlibrary(\"igraph\")\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(\"tidygraph\")\nA .csv file was brought into the system.\n# Bring the dataset into R as a dataframe\ninput_data&lt;-read.csv(file.choose())\nTo ensure the R script is reusable and not overly prescriptive regarding the dataset layout, it prompts the user to identify the column containing the row IDs.\n# define the IDs for the nodes from the list in the console\n{\ncat(\"Available columns:\\n\")\nprint(names(input_data))\nID_col &lt;- readline(prompt = \"Enter the name of the column containing the index IDs: \")\n}\n{\nif (!(ID_col %in% names(input_data))) {\n  stop(\"Column name not found.

If multiple kinds of relationships are recorded and the user would like to combine them before running the analysis, multiple column names can be entered and comma separated. Alternatively, users could rerun the analysis, selecting different relationship record columns each time.

From the lists, an adjacency matrix can be produced for network analysis.\n# Create edge list from Masterdata\nedge_list &lt;- Masterdata %&gt;%\n  rowwise() %&gt;%\n  mutate(targets = strsplit(relations, \";\\\\s*\")) %&gt;%\n  unnest(targets) %&gt;%\n  filter(targets != \"\") %&gt;%\n  distinct(df_IDs, targets)\n\n# Get all unique nodes\nnodes &lt;- sort(unique(c(Masterdata$df_IDs, edge_list$targets)))\n\n# Create adjacency matrix\nadj_matrix &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = length(nodes), ncol = length(nodes),\n                     dimnames = list(nodes, nodes))\n# Fill matrix with 1s for directed edges\nfor (i in 1:nrow(edge_list)) {\n  from &lt;- edge_list$df_IDs[i]\n  to &lt;- edge_list$targets[i]\n  adj_matrix[from, to] &lt;- 1\n}\nFrom the adjacency matrix, directed asymmetric relationships are generated between dyads (i.e. pairs of nodes) using the igraph package.

Both the UKRN Local Network and the Library are relatively central and well connected within the largest connected cluster. There are four distinct communities within this cluster, comprising the School of Healthcare Enterprise and Innovation and its activities and links; Open Science training in Psychology, offered by one member of staff and UKRN Local Network member; the UKRN Local Network and other networks and initiatives which share an interest in reproducible and transparent research practices; and the Library alongside other Professional Services infrastructures, funding, and those benefiting from those services but not currently engaging with the wider network. There is a fifth distinct community comprising of NIHR infrastructures which support reproducible and transparent practices, but there is no recorded symmetric or asymmetric engagement between this cluster and the other in respect to these practices and principles.\nIn the largest cluster, the Library and the UKRN Local Network have the greatest betweenness centrality, respectively.

    "text": "Discussion\nA node with high closeness centrality is efficient at communicating. Therefore, based on this analysis, the Library and UKRN Local Network are the most advantageously placed to communicate reproducible and transparent research practices. One node is an infrastructure, being part of the University’s Professional Services, and the other is an organisational network, which means they are well placed to work collaboratively. However, both nodes occupy a similar space and share many relationships, demonstrating a degree of homophily.\nIn the cases of the School of Healthcare Enterprise and Innovation and the School of Psychology, individual UKRN Local Network members are acting as bridging ties between activities in their respective groups. Therefore, these links are valuable, but potentially vulnerable.\nDespite some vulnerable bridging ties and a degree of observable homophily, popularity and transitivity are observably fostering improved connectivity within the network. The Library is a good example that popularity – i.e. the propensity to establish more ties is increasingly likely for nodes with more existing ties – can grow the influence of an infrastructure over others in specific areas of interest – in this case, Open Research. Transitivity – the dependence between triplets, i.e. a friend of a friend is also a friend – can also be observed numerous times between the UKRN Local Network e.g. with ReproducibiliTea, PSDI, Software Sustainability Institute, CaSDaR etc. Indeed, it was through some of these ties that the multi-departmental CaSDaR funding bid was established."

    "text": "Conclusions\nThrough this exercise 22 activities or centres of activity were identified. Those ranged from individual initiatives to deliver training, to funded activities to improve reproducibility, to established enterprise units, organisational networks, funding, infrastructures and services. The time and network limitations of this self-reporting study mean that it is possible for more nodes to be added in future, but it is likely those will have weak bridging ties or will be distinct communities.\nPopularity and transitivity have the potential to grow the influence of the UKRN Local Network and Library over time. However, the mechanisms underpinning the observed homophily present a limiting factor. The purpose of the UKRN is to “enable researchers and research-enablers, academic institutions, and other sectoral organisations working in the UK research system to collaborate, so they are better able to conduct and promote rigorous, reproducible, and transparent research” (https://www.ukrn.org/terms-of-reference/, retrieved 29/10/2025). Therefore, efforts should be made to increase reciprocity between the UKRN Local Network and diverse research disciplines and practices, and where possible links should be established or strengthened with individuals, networks, and infrastructures in those areas to take advantage of the transitivity and popularity effects.\n\nFuture improvements\nColour coding ties: Reintroducing information about the level of engagement, collaboration, or sharing of staff into the output graphs through colour coding of ties could help visualise the strength of the networks.\nRe-running the exercise: Re-running the exercise in the future could demonstrate how the network changes over time and highlight effective interventions.\nReplication studies: This output has been produced in R using Quarto, it is shared in a GitHub repository and can be adapted, reused, and built upon. The University of Southampton case study can act as a point of reference for other similar studies."
